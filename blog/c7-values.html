  Hey!  Another blog post about stereotype threat.  After I had written about it was no big deal to me.  Hmmm...
</p>

<p>
  It looks like we're focusing on affirmation this week, though.  I think that's sort of how I've lived my entire life. My family would constantly affirm for me that I could do something and never really mentioned why I should even think that I wouldn't be able to.  So I can say that I believe that affirmations help to combat stereotype threat, in that I've never really felt it.  But in the same way, I've never been to outer space, so maybe affirmations prevent visits to outer space too. :)
  </p>

  <p>
    Onwards!  My values that help to prevent me from experiencing stereotype threat, in theory, are....
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Achievement</li>
  <li>Competence</li>
  <li>Coolness under fire</li>
  <li>Independence</li>
  <li>Integrity</li>
  <li>Intelligence</li>
  <li>Personal Development</li>
  <li>Self-reliance</li>
  <li>Truth</li>
  <li>Efficiency</li>
  <li>Wisdom</li>
</ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    In general, I try to live up to these as much as possible, all the way.  On a scale of 1 to 5, (1 being not at all and 5 being always) I try to live up to them 10.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are the values that were trumpeted in my household growing up, so it's only natural for them to stick with me.  The one I cling to the most is integrity.  Being a person of integrity meant being trustworthy to always do the right thing.  If people don't find you a person of integrity, then why would they bother with you at all, stereotypes or not? 
  </p>

  <p>
    The second most important value in that list to me is Truth.  If you can't face or tell the truth, then something about the situation you're in is very, very wrong.  I did have a friend ask me about the relationship he was in recently.  He wanted to leave the relationship, but he was afraid she would hurt herself if he left.  I told him that by essentially lying to her and telling her he still wanted a relationship, he wasn't going to help anyone in the long run.  He should try to get her help, but be honest.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like to think that I live up to these values, but honestly, I do fall short quite often. If I ever felt stereotype threat, I'm sure thinking of them and striving for them would help.  But then again, they'd be helpful in pretty much any aituation, including going to outer space. :)
