Using CSS to Torture Mice, Because Why Not?

"You know what, Mac? You're right. I didn't like Cheese. I had difficulty tolerating Cheese. And as far as I could tell, nobody else really had a taste for Cheese, either. Except the mice. Mice like Cheese. "
-Bloo, Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends

<p>Let's say you've got an adorable mouse:</p>

<p>
<img src="imgs/Mouse.png" alt="Mouse"/>
<br/>Hello!
</p>

<p>And you've got some yummy cheese:</p>

<p>
	<img src="imgs/Cheese.png" alt="Cheese"/>
<br/>... (Cheese can't talk!)
</p>

<p>And now let's say you need the two of them in the same line in an html document:</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
	&lt;html&gt;
	<body>
		<img src="imgs/Cheese.png"/>
		<img src="imgs/Mouse.png"/>
	</body>
	</html>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Then you get this:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="imgs/Cheese.png"/>
		<img src="imgs/Mouse.png"/>
		<br/>Whoa, there, mouse!  We all know your issues with self control!  We need that cheese for our demonstration today!
	</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can use simple CSS to seperate the two.  In fact, there are several ways to push them around once we've enclosed them in blocks in a css class, like so:</p>

<p>
	<pre><code>
		.blocked {
	display: block;
	}
	</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Now we just assign the class to the mouse and cheese in a <pre><div></pre> tag, like so:</p>

<p><pre><code>
<html>
<body>
	<div class = "blocked">
	<img src="imgs/Cheese.png">
	</div>
	<div>
	<img src="imgs/Mouse.png">
	</div>
</body>
</html>
</code></pre></p>

<p>And voila!  They're seperated!</p>

<div class="blocked1">
	<img src="imgs/Cheese.png" alt="Cheese!">
</div>
<div class = "blocked1">
	<img src="imgs/Mouse.png" alt="Mouse!">
</div>

<p>But wait, you say, we wanted them on the same line!  You make a good point.  We'll need to change our blocked class so that they're both enclosed in inline-blocks, like so:</p>

<p>
	<pre><code>
		.blocked {
		display: inline-block;
	}
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Since we've already assigned the class to the mouse and cheese, we don't need to make any changes to the html.  Now that gets us this:</p>

<p>
<div class="blocked2">
	<img src="imgs/Cheese.png" alt="Cheese!">
</div>
<div class = "blocked2">
	<img src="imgs/Mouse.png" alt="Mouse!">
</div>
</p>

<p>Darnit!  That mouse is at it again!  We're going to need to use CSS to alter the inline-blocks to push the two apart.  Again, CSS gives us several ways to do this, each with their own subtle effects.</p>

<p><h1>Elements of a block</h1></p>

<p>The margin is the area surrounding the block.
